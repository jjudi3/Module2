      <p>Coldplay formed at the University College of London in 1998 by guitarists Martin, a pianist from childhood and also a singer, and Jon Buckland; they were later joined by drummer Will Champion and bassist Guy Berryman. They played their first shows as "the Coldplay," and in 1998 self-issued an EP, Safety. The following year, the group released the Brothers and Sisters EP on U.K. indie Fierce Panda, performed their first sessions for the BBC Radio 1 presenter Steve Lamacq, played Glastonbury, and signed to Parlophone in short order. 
      he band acknowledges the Scottish alternative rock band, Travis, as a major influence on their earlier material.  Despite their worldwide popularity, the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media, refusing its use for product endorsements.</p>
